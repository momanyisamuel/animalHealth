### UI and features
<img src="mockups/homepage.png" alt="Example UI" width="80%"/>

_Example UI with modern web browser._

The UI should be responsive design and work with different screen sizes. You don't need to support legacy browsers, so UI needs to work only on modern desktop and mobile browsers.

#### Requirements

* A map area to show a topographic view of symptoms reported
* A simple navigation bar to navigate to other pages
* A sidebar with a list of symptoms currently visible on the map 
* A detail view of a symptom, its info and comments
